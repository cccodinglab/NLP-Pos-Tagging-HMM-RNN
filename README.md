# NLP-POS-Tagging-Comparison: HMM vs. RNN

## DESCRIPTION ##
POS-tagging is one of the key steps in Natural Language Processing. We compare the classical approach-Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with some variants of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). 

## CODE ##
This repository contains two separate files for the implementation of POS-tagging models:
1. File: HMM.ipynb - Implementation of the classical Hidden Markov Model for POS-tagging
2. File: RNN.ipynb - Implementation of various Recurrent Neural Network variants for POS-tagging
